Session ID 201:

Family Medicine Education Reform Update

Break Out session:

• Dr. Gower - general concerns proposed to Ivy Oandasan, Kristy Penner

- Concerns regarding difference between rural and urban residents

- Voicing that when they come to rural communities they are trained more versatile they are supervised in this first year of practice

- When residents are coming into practice now we have a baseline desire to be more sub specialized, there are individuals who are interested in more of a focused practice with a roster vs those who wish to pursue subspecialty training

- We should look specifically at HHR needs

• Topics:

- Ideas for curriculum development for practice preparedness

- Ideas for curriculum development about inter-professional teams

- Ideas about curriculum reform and certificates of added competence

- Curriculum ideas for priority topics:

• Home and long term care

• Addictions and mental health

• Indigenous Health

• Health and Equity and Anti-Racism Practices

• ER and Acute Care

• Virtual Care and Informatics

• Dr. Wallace (North Bay):

- She herself is a new grad

- Her concerns are specifically in regard to flow, and general approach to learning curves for new grads. Predominantly administrative in nature; for anyone who has trained out of province and moves provinces, cities there is always a learning curve.

• Dr. Witt ( Saskatoon):

- Re-invisioning the third year do we actually need a year of training or do we need several years of mentorship. Teaching them how to run their clinic, how have clinic flow, billing.

- We should be looking more at mentorship and opportunities after graduation for residents rather than telling them they are independent and forcing the into

• Dr. Ramirez (Alliston, ON)

- Reframing the approach to second year

- Mentorship, making sure they are set up and ready for practice - get into habits of checking labs, running a clinic, costs etc.

- Start doing this in second year, thoughts that this could be used in third year

• Dr. Mostert ( Resident)

- Believes that this year would not necessarily instil competence rather than confidence

- The extra year is going to slow things down for family medicine, “turning down the tap for family medicine residents

• Dr. Rutherford:

- This really depends on how general we expect the skills to be

- You need to be developing these skill sets

• Dr. Wallace:

- Consideration that we should be having more of a mentorship role of the third year vs an actual residency

- There is a cognitive dissonance between being a resident and being a staff; and having a transitional year as a resident would not necessarily provide this.

• Dr. Casey:

- Agrees that mentorship / apprenticeship would be more beneficial

• Dr. Witt:

- If we take the money towards what it would cost to hold onto residents for an extra year and re-imagine it to a multiple year graduated support system for residents after graduation. It would potentially provide better resources for supports.

- These supports could potentially provide opportunities for residents to seek out opportunities in areas that they have identified as areas of weakness: ie fellowship and in paediatrics/ palliative/ additional PGY3 year of ER Etc.

Education Reform FOCUS GROUP 1 - 2023 Rural and Remote

* All constituents of the focus deal with long-term-care, mental health and addiction, indigenous health, racism, ER and acute care, Virtual Care.

Main impressions from SRPC focus group conversation:

1) It is suggested that rural residency programs should continue at two years, as learners typically acquire proficiency and confidence at a faster rate compared to three years in urban settings.

2) While a third year is generally not considered necessary, if implemented, it should offer the following:

- Allow residents to bill at a locum rate or receive advanced residency salaries.

- Provide more independence in the third year, enabling residents to act as locums and take on staff level responsibilities.

- Establish a structure that encourages residents to assume greater responsibility and offload some of the preceptor's duties.

3) Recruiting physicians to serve as preceptors and teach has become increasingly challenging.

4) To promote diversity of exposure, residents should use nearby facilities to gain experience in various rural settings, addressing the notion that "if you have seen one rural setting, you have seen them all."

5) The CCFP exam should still take place after two years.

6) Mandated, challenging rural rotations should be implemented, along with debriefing sessions to discuss and improve the skills required to overcome the main challenges encountered.

7) Residents should receive education on negotiating with specialists when referrals are refused, as well as on managing conflicts with agitated administrative staff.

8) There is a need for increased education and resources focused on managing the business aspects of running a practice, as this is currently a source of anxiety for residents and often avoided.

9) Consider mandating one year of rural practice.

10) Incorporate additional mental health components into the curriculum, as current impressions suggest that residents do not receive adequate training in this area.

11) Identify and support residents who show a strong interest in rural medicine and specialties.

12) Explore necessary legislative changes to facilitate greater independence for mature residents and reduce the need for oversight.

13) Residency program training time has decreased by approximately 20% over the last decade.

14) Introduce competency-based assessments for students who do not demonstrate proficiency in certain areas.

15) Decisions regarding an individualized extended residency should be based on extensive dialogue with the preceptor.

16) Allocate focused time for continuity of care, such as calling back patients and following up on labs that are not necessarily tied to the clinic setting.

SRPC Conversation re OTP

• Transitions are intrinsically difficult, longer training will not change that.

• The project keeps training.

• This project is trying to accomplish what actually happens on the ground when a new physician arrives in a rural community.

• The fundamental problem is that students aren’t choosing Family Medicine and those who do are often not choosing broad scope family medicine, which is currently a more difficult and worse paid option.

• The IMG issue in rural as required teachers.

• Education design should focus on meeting the needs of the communities

• CACs should be focused on re-entry and training for community needs

• More training does not enhance adaptability. In fact may convince people that they should only do what they experienced in the residency. Adaptability is a key skill set for rural generalists.

• A third year must not be more of the same.

• Is the problem we are addressing actually the covert re-design that has happened with urban programs?

• For urban residents who don’t experience comprehensive care dropping them into a 3rd year comprehensive environment will be jarring and probably not change practice.

• Disconnected from practice reform.

• Maybe the learning opportunity needs to be 6 months in your 3rd year of practice and 6 months in your 5th year of practice.

• The assumption is that people need to do it all but this is wasted resources in communities where FMDs cannot do it all and physicians who do not want to do it all.

• 3rd year may drive subspecialization.

• Family doctors are pulled into so many non family medicine roles that prop up the broken health system. This leads to 2 different issues. The rural issue is that there are not enough doctors. The urban issue is that family doctors are pulled into a huge number of non FMD roles (that are vital to keep the overall system running) but mean that even in an area with ‘enough ’physicians there are not enough physicians who provide longitudinal FM.

• Training capacity is a central issue. People in a third year need to have an VERY expanded role in teaching of the medical students and residents.

• Need new models of teaching to support the increased capacity. It will not be possible to create capacity in the current model.

• Residents will need to be trained in teaching, faculty development for rural preceptors needs to be extended to FM residents.

• TEACHING NEDS TO BE A PRIORITY FOCUS OF THE CURRICULUM.

• Further driving sub specialization is a potential risk. The health system will be happy to take these even better trained people into roles that prop up the health system and are in general easier and better paid than FM.

• For rural programs one of the focuses might actually be office based FM

• The end of the 12 month internship resulted in decreased scope of FM with 2 years. The system has changed and has decreased scope. More training will not increase scope because this is a system issue, and in fact may worsen credential creep and further decrease scope.

• A third year will worsen trained helplessness.

Session:

- No focus on patient considerations?

- Rural sacrificed on the back of urban residents

- We want to see what you consider to be the risks ad how the opportuntites will be seized

What do you think?

- One of the comments about the reason fir extra time came for the sense that programs couldn’t fit in extra objectives in time allotted. But lots of variability between programmes, sites, preceptors, and one of the themes that they have heard a lot. Year after year in block-based program one of the themes that comes up is there are many rotations that are not valuable we don’t need to have non valuable rotations in the mix. We should optimize the time, the extra length seems to happen no matter what so maybe we could modify to make things matter more. These are generally the surgical rotations where its almost only observation which is not particularly valuable or minor paperwork/basic consults.

- There is a ton of site-to-site variability even in site having several clinics. Not a bad thing, they have a rank list for sites, that is okay because not everyone wants to do everything and that is perfectly fine. Having a longitudinal second year allows them to do everything and be competent in everything. They can do main rotation and not put extra time into things they aren’t interested in developing further competence in. So right now have two that are interested in primary care two emerg and two everything which means that they get the opportunity to specialize. Don’t know if ‘forcing’ them to do other things is beneficial to their practice style.

- Without a good look at what is valuable currently means that we can’t match where we want to go. She was very involved in ccc curriculum and one of their observations was unless the dep of fm change dramatically ccc would never be met. You can’t force people to do things but people come back from 3rd year clerkship and say wow I didn’t know you could live a life and do all of these things. So we need people in these mentorship live that live full lives. We need to look at who the program directors are as gold standards, but these people aren’t full comprehensive family medicine doctors so we need to evaluate who we are elevating on this pedestal.

- Developed a program in K-waterloo and had a great mix of urban and rural, started at 6 then to 21. Then to nova scotia at a brand new site that is much more rural, very thankful to have the previous experience otherwise it wouldn’t work. One of the thing that is missing is the value of solid administrative structure. For this to happen well we need people willing to speak face to face with physicians. The end goal is to see every resident come out of the program knowing where they want to go. If we don’t have good admin for periodic review (at dal) we lose a lot of the value of the program. What is general surgery as a residency? Sitting there or helping out. Specialists should be made aware that they are teaching FM not a clerk coming in for a rotation. We need admin to getting the faculty development going. They like longitudinal, ‘design your own’ adventure’ many want more training but do they need it.

- Impt distinction between long and bb we will never transition to one or the other but subjects in long seemed to learn much better. The emphasis/challenging subjects could be done in this manner for emerg. She trained in NS and found that the block based nature of Obs/gyn was very

centralized which made learning challenging. Have some further integration into longitudinal programs would help with learning.

- Many things on the list are not amenable to a 2-week block or a few lectures, they need to be integrated into everyday. Not just longitudinal (acknowledges advocates for longitudinal clerkship) the other example is virtual care, can’t imagine that’s not day to day so need some intentionality around the theoretical pieces but that can be done while you are doing other things and doesn’t need a whole mess of new time. Yes there are more things but why can’t we integrate them

- I don’t’ even know if this is possible bc there are no preceptors. Scared for sites that have no preceptors, he ahs no new preceptors in the past 4 years and 2 left. I honestly don’t know if this is possible and even if this is fabulous and good education I don’t even know if we can do it. If we are going to increase s[pots by 50% I don’t even know where to put them. Curriculum redesign may nee to address them because I don’t know where I am going to fit them.

- And burnout!

- Do you have the infrastructure in hospitals?

- It is a problem but the bigger issue is people coming into fm program we run out of preceptors so pipeline is running dry.

- On layered learning, resident can be teaching younger resident so it is all about faculty development.

- You’ve gotta have faculty to develop faculty though! There are lots of ways around it but It really needs a systems change other than just a 50% increase!

- We have met with NS health and because of the push for more resources. We have money now so making changes now and improving FM docs offices to take on more and improve infrastructure.

- IN northern alberta, some communities have had to take a pause from all teaching over the past 12 months (*they were once longstanding and secure). Those communities that were once rock steady are falling apart so capacity is a huge issue. If this third year is actually a transition to practice where they are not a resident but practicing with an intentional relationship with senior it would be doable and could be valuable. Back in her time you looked for a community where you thought you could find support and left if it didn’t work out. But if this was an intentional relationship where they were a functional physician and talked about it as a transition to practice not a third year of residency it would be better. I am not sure if any of us really felt prepared, she had what she needed but not necessarily ready for it. It’s a new transformation to a new identity. From 2 year FM med residency even procedural skills she learned to do c-sections and counselling. What’s in the two years? How do we make this the best we can? I’d sign on to a third years transition to practice with a mentor

- Could be adapted to the individual resident. Some need 5 , some need 1, some need 18 months it could be much more tailored to the individual resident. I was looking at the list of what needed adding and I was looking like what are they doing? There will always be things missing but sometimes you just need to learn to fend for yourself.

- Ill be a broken record about the admin piece because she believes that many things over residency shouldn’t require admin. One community in her area has ortho so everyone has to go there so very complicated, and they use google calendars for schedules can track clinical experiences and although don’t get 8 weeks of anything over two years you can really get

competency down. Finds it is very helpful for resident to see what is going on although can’t edit there are many things that help capture what they are getting. And then the ITARs and faculty understand what does it mean for a fam doc and when do they no longer need to be evaluated on this. I find residents are empowered when they can look ahead to see what the next 12 months will look like. And then recruitment community resources of people, not about recruiting you but getting you acquainted to community but how can we get you to know your community to hopefully improve transition to practice down the line.

- Something that is really front and center in cpd research. At UBC we have a program for new grads to coach and mentor them, they don’t report so safer env. This helps coach when they get to UBC to offload the burden on residency programs. There is a whole lot more learning that happens after residency. Excited to year mentoring is important ot people.

- Most in rural sites learn that you can evolve what you do in your practice and tailor what you do based on communities needs and you may not have all those skills after graduating but you can learn after practice. And knowing that has given her a lot of comfort. If I chose to pursue something in that context I can get those skills. I can do extra emerg training in Toronto etc.

- We work with residents and to know we are there is valuable and we do fill gaps ex for pocus which is not in bc program

- Orientation is so important, so we spread it out oer the summer. Recruiters have a little better stage and it is now less about trying to recruit and moere about seeing their interest.

- This si tangential so I think three years is too short to figure out what they are doing in conference. Looking at 10 years of data

- The group that geos rural 1-5 years there is a whole block of people that make a change within that block so three years is too early to make changes or examine how people are retained in that community.

- It may be planned that year so they may want to be there temporarily and move out later.

- If we choose the wring time period, then we may get the wrong data.

- If we stay 7 years more likely to stay 11 and stay 11 more likely to day 14, sort of 10 years post you may be looking for another challenging and that may be taking on leadership/politics in community, something with a professional organization, or academia. In rural context some may get into community in different ways ex farm or ski trails. And they could do their practice anywhere.

- What did you think about unintended consequences behind CAC programs. I know CAC may be controversial in some context. How will that change in family medicine going forward. I just wondering about the unintended consequences of that. I wonder how the CACS will be impacted by this they cannot be worked differently but must part of this

- DO your tow years and then go back to get further specialization based in the community that you are in? I remembering some interviews with new grads at the time and met someone who had planned on doing a CAC but went to a rural community and never would have gone their unless they went rural.

- It would be good to see the results of their own study but it would be good to see results of etjri own study. CAC seems to be for urban specialized practices. IM CAC was supposed to be rural but didn’t work out that way.

General Discussion

- Much of the framing is regarding making transitions easier

o Transitions are inherently challenging. We should focus on supports

- POCUS could be done in the 3-day course

- A structured mentorship program has been built into the transition in rural communities like Moose Bay

- “Why do we not do what we already do now… where we mentor new trainees”

- We should be solving the issue of people willing to go into the family medicine first

- The college has yet to look at the physician turnover

- IMGs are being recruited to rural settings like Alberta, the college doesn’t allow CPFC teaching

o The goal should be to serve society opposed

Ideas for curriculum development for practice preparedness

- Mentorship

- A year of practice preparedness was not necessary coming from Saskatchewan given the team/bigger practices in Ontario

- Transition to practice is dependent on the team

- Maybe the third year should be integrated later on into your practice (i.e., 6 months during your 3rd year of practice, and another 6 months in your 5th year of practice)

- Some people don’t want to see do emergency, or other parts of FM practice

o Some people have goals that don’t align with comprehensive practice and that is okay

§ Residency programs are unique and train people with specific skills that are specific to their communities

- What does it look like for those who are off-cycle when there is additional training

- Why not make the 3rd year a CAC + proper pay

o This would enhance the problem due to subspecialization/CAC

- Family doctors are well trained, but the issue is that family doctors are being used to bridge a broader problem—the fact that the system is having issues

- Better schedules and pay should be part of fixing the problem

- How can the make the practice of family medicine retain opposed to adjusting the training

- The family medicine practice is causing the surge in emerg, we should focus on improving the retention of family doctors

o Some communities cannot access their family doctors timely

- The 3rd year fellows should have an expanded role in teaching learners below them

o 2nd year residents teach 1st year residents and medical students

o A clear role, expectation, and supports for teaching should be present

o Feedback should be provided to residents (teaching the teachers)

Ideas for curriculum development about interprofessional teams

-

Ideas about curriculum reform and certificates of added competence (CAC)

- CACs take people out of longitudinal competence

- They should be designed to address the needs within that community

- If the goals is to meet communities, CACs should be re-entry positions

- If you want to do a year of EM, it should be decided on the fact that your community needs this

o You should be paid reasonably to leave your practice

- Agreed that we should train people to have adaptability

o The idea of training everyone in everything in a 3-year program, is counterintuitive because we should be fostering adaptability and comfort in adaptability

o We should focus on “how can we create people who can identify a need and come up with solutions”

- We should focus on who is entering family medicine to ensure that they meet

- In a rural setting, a third-year doesn’t change much for some rural settings

o Alt perspective: a third year of seeing additional practice for city folks will not increase comprehensiveness anyway

- A self-directed third year, you don’t know what you will need (compared to your perceived needs)

o The

Curriculum ideas for curriculum

- EM and critical care — a third year could be focused on this but could be counterintuitive since it may result in over sub-specialization

- A more clear focus on specialties

- From the list, some rural medicine programs already focus on

- More curriculum development for issues like health equity and anti-racist practice for rural programs

o Focus on how to increase exposure

- In rural practice, there might be too much acute care (or a specific niche), resulting in a lack of practice

- Clinical courage has been limited by systemic changes over time (e.g., less courage to do an LP without having done one before)

Family Medicine Education Reform: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Present and the Future

Introduction

Family medicine, an essential pillar of the healthcare system, has been experiencing significant transitions over recent years. These changes, while critical, present a series of challenges and necessitate thoughtful, strategic reforms in the education and training of future physicians. In analyzing a series of discussions surrounding these issues, several key themes and priorities have emerged, each of which warrants further exploration and action.

Rural versus Urban Residency

The first major theme is the apparent disparity between rural and urban residency training. The data reveal that rural residencies often provide a broader scope of practice, fostering greater versatility in early-career physicians. Dr. Gower's concerns, raised in the session "Family Medicine Education Reform Update," reflect this, highlighting that when rural-trained physicians transition into practice, they are often more adaptable, particularly in diverse, rural communities. Conversely, urban residencies, with their tendency towards specialization, may not offer the same breadth of experience. Reconciling this divide necessitates the integration of a broader range of experiences into urban residencies, thereby producing more versatile physicians capable of serving diverse community needs.

The Role of Mentorship

The role of mentorship in the transition from residency to independent practice is a reoccurring theme. Multiple participants, including Dr. Witt from Saskatoon and Dr. Wallace from North Bay, propose a shift from the traditional residency model towards a mentorship or apprenticeship model. This suggestion is supported by the observed learning curves and challenges faced by new graduates, emphasizing that real-world experiences, guided by seasoned physicians, can more effectively prepare residents for the realities of running a clinic. Such a model would expose residents to practical aspects of the job, such as managing administrative tasks and understanding billing procedures, thus smoothing their transition into practice.

Reforming Family Medicine Education

There is a widespread consensus on the urgent need to reform the Family Medicine curriculum. The proposed ideas are multifaceted, targeting several key areas for inclusion or expansion. These include health equity and anti-racism practices, mental health and addiction services, inter-professional team collaboration, virtual care, and general practice preparedness. This proposed reform signifies a shift towards a more holistic approach to patient care, reflecting the evolving needs of the communities that family physicians serve.

Curriculum Focus on Community Needs

A strong sentiment emerging from the discussions is the crucial need for the curriculum to meet specific community needs. This is particularly relevant for rural communities, which often require broad-scope family medicine practitioners. The discussions suggest that students must be prepared not just theoretically, but practically, for the realities of serving in these communities. As mentioned in the SRPC Conversation re OTP, education design should focus on community needs, highlighting the importance of a tailored, community-centric approach to medical education.

Transition to Practice

Transitioning from a resident to an independent practitioner presents a steep learning curve for new graduates. Administrative procedures, clinic flow management, and the potential need to relocate between provinces or cities all contribute to this challenge. By preparing residents for these realities during their training, the transition into practice can be significantly eased.

Concerns about Subspecialization

The discussion also reflects concerns about an increasing tendency towards subspecialization in family medicine. An extended training period or overemphasis on certain aspects of the curriculum could inadvertently drive more students towards subspecialization, thereby leading to a potential shortage of general family medicine practitioners, especially in rural areas. This concern underscores the need for careful consideration in curriculum design to ensure a balanced emphasis on both general and specialized areas.

Third-Year Residency

Others, like Dr. Mostert, express concern that an additional year could slow down the pipeline of family medicine residents, potentially limiting the number of practitioners entering the field. Dr. Witt proposes an innovative compromise, suggesting that resources could be better utilized in a graduated support system for residents post-graduation. This system could provide residents with the opportunity to seek further training in areas they identify as weaknesses, thereby providing a more tailored and relevant educational experience.

The Power of Apprenticeship

Echoing these sentiments, both Dr. Wallace and Dr. Casey emphasize the potential value of an apprenticeship-style third year. They argue that this model could bridge the cognitive dissonance between being a resident and being a staff physician, providing a smoother transition and better preparing graduates for the realities of practice. Their perspective is supported by the reality that newly graduated physicians often face a steep learning curve, suggesting that an additional year of guided practice could enhance preparedness.

Reimagining Resource Allocation

Dr. Witt provides an intriguing perspective on how to better utilize resources. He suggests that funds allocated towards extending residency could instead be invested in a multi-year graduated support system for residents post-graduation. This approach could provide better resources and support for new graduates, addressing identified areas of weakness and facilitating continued learning and development in the early years of practice.

Conclusion

Family medicine is at a crossroads. The field's evolving scope, changing community needs, and the shifting landscape of medical education necessitate comprehensive reforms. The themes emerging from these discussions - reconciling rural and urban residency experiences, the critical role of mentorship, the need for curriculum reform, the focus on community needs, smoothing the transition into practice, concerns about subspecialization, and the debate surrounding a third year of residency - collectively illustrate the multifaceted challenges and opportunities facing family medicine education.
